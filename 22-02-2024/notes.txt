Flex Box 

Container and Items:

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
The container becomes a flex container by applying display: flex; or display: inline-flex; to it.
The child elements inside the container become flex items.

Main Axis and Cross Axis:
Flexbox works along two axes: the main axis and the cross axis.
The flex-direction property defines the main axis direction (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.
Justify Content:

justify-content aligns items along the main axis.
Values: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.
Align Items and Align Self:

align-items aligns items along the cross axis.
Values: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch.
align-self allows individual items to override align-items.
Flex Container Properties:

flex-direction: Defines the main axis direction.
flex-wrap: Controls whether items should wrap.
flex-flow: A shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap.
justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis.
align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis.
align-content: Aligns content when there is extra space on the cross axis.
Flex Item Properties:

order: Specifies the order of the flex item.
flex-grow: Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest.
flex-shrink: Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest.
flex-basis: Specifies the initial size of a flex item.
flex: A shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
Responsive Design with Flexbox:

Flexbox is great for creating responsive layouts.
Combine with media queries to adjust layout based on screen size.
